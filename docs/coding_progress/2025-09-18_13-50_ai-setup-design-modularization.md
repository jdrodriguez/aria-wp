# 2025-09-18 13:50 ET – AI Setup & Design Page Modularization

## Summary
- Refactored the AI Setup (AIConfig) admin screen to use shared layout primitives with modular sections covering provider selection, model tuning, usage insights, and save actions.
- Introduced dedicated React section directories (`ai-config-sections/`, `design-sections/`) with PropTypes and consistent data flow, replacing large monolithic components.
- Rebuilt page-specific SCSS (`_ai-config.scss`, `_design.scss`) to use scoped BEM classes, removing inline styles while ensuring responsiveness and design parity with other admin pages.
- Standardized content indexing metrics to use the shared `ModernMetricCard` icons (stack/check/clock/storage) so the page renders cleanly without runtime prop-type errors.
- Wrapped WordPress form controls (`SelectControl`, `TextControl`, `TextareaControl`, `ToggleControl`, `SearchControl`) with defaults for the new `__next` props to silence 6.7/6.8 deprecation warnings across admin screens.
- Normalized conversation logging (role sanitization, context reconstruction) and guarded the background processor queue from duplicate events to protect runtime integrity.
- Replaced mocked Knowledge Base flows with the live AJAX stack, returning sanitized entries, dynamic category filters, and usage metrics for the React admin.
- Wired the Design admin to persisted settings via new AJAX endpoints, sanitizing options/colours and loading statefully in the React UI.
- Upgraded Settings ▸ Notifications to load/save through real endpoints, with inline validation, loading/test states, and backend sanitization for recipients.
- Mirrored the same treatment for Settings ▸ Privacy, persisting GDPR toggles/retention policy via AJAX with form validation and live loading states.
- Completed Settings ▸ License with activation/storage endpoints, inline validation, and status indicators.
- Gave AI Setup a visual pass: provider/model sections now use SectionCard layouts with icons, ModernMetric cards for usage stats, and refreshed panel styling.
