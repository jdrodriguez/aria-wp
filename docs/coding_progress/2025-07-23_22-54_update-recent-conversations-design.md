**Task:** Update Recent Conversations section to match modern card-based design system

## Summary

Successfully updated the Recent Conversations section in the dashboard to use the consistent modern card design system, eliminating the styling inconsistency that was using different class naming conventions.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Structure Update
- **Replaced**: `aria-activity-section` with `aria-metric-card aria-metric-card--info`
- **Updated**: Section header to use `aria-metric-header` and `aria-metric-label`
- **Improved**: "View All" link styling to use `aria-metric-trend neutral`
- **Renamed**: Activity classes to conversation classes for semantic clarity
- **Enhanced**: Empty state with icon and proper styling

### 2. CSS Implementation
- **Added**: `.aria-conversation-list` with flexbox layout and consistent spacing
- **Created**: `.aria-conversation-item` with gradient background and hover effects
- **Styled**: `.aria-conversation-header` with proper spacing and typography
- **Implemented**: `.aria-status-badge` with gradient styling for success/neutral states
- **Added**: `.aria-conversation-empty` with centered layout and icon
- **Created**: `.aria-secondary-grid` for responsive two-column layout

### 3. Design System Consistency
- **Gradients**: Applied consistent gradient patterns matching metric cards
- **Hover Effects**: Added subtle transform and background changes
- **Typography**: Used consistent font weights, sizes, and colors
- **Spacing**: Applied design tokens for consistent spacing
