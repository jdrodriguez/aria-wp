# 2025-09-18 11:05 ET â€“ Content Indexing Page Modularization

## Summary
- Refactored the Content Indexing React page into modular sections (metrics, actions, settings, filters, list, progress modal) backed by the shared layout primitives, eliminating the bespoke card markup and inline styles.
- Added scoped SCSS utilities (`_content-indexing.scss`) for badges, empty states, and modal layout so the UI aligns with the new design system across admin screens.
- Preserved existing behavior for indexing runs, status toggles, and search filters while simplifying state wiring and preparing for real API integrations.

## Verification
- `npx eslint src/js/admin/pages/ContentIndexing.jsx src/js/admin/pages/content-indexing-sections/*.jsx`
