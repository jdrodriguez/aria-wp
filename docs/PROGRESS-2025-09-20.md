# Aria Progress Log — 2025-09-20

## Admin UX Improvements
- Added AI draft summary card to the Knowledge Entry review step for fast validation of generated content.
- Introduced results summaries (“Showing N of M…”) and quick-filter pills across Knowledge, Conversations, and Content Indexing pages.
- Updated Conversations and Content Indexing lists with shared styling tokens; refreshed Personality trait cards for consistent design.
- Added reusable `ResultsSummary` component and centralized SCSS styling for summary rows.

## AI Provider Reliability
- Gemini provider now maps legacy model slugs to supported Flash tiers, stores sanitized errors in a transient, and clears them on success.
- OpenAI provider mirrors the same transient logging; admin notice now displays provider name, failure reason, and “Retest Connection” CTA that auto-tests the saved key.

## Platform Hardening
- Activation checks for an existing license row before inserting, preventing duplicate-key SQL warnings.
- Content indexing metrics verify table/column existence before running heavy queries, silencing legacy “chunk_embedding” errors.
- Cron scheduling for `aria_cleanup_cache` now includes a back-off mechanism to avoid repeated “could_not_set” warnings.
- WordPress debug log rotated to surface only new issues.

## Testing & Tooling
- Added PHPUnit coverage for the AI provider error notice to prevent regressions in the new transient-based messaging.
- `composer test` currently fails due to missing WordPress test library (`bin/install-wp-tests.sh` not run in this environment).

## Next Focus
- Expand the “Retest Connection” shortcut with direct feedback on the AI Setup screen.
- Extend results summary pattern to any remaining admin lists and continue UI token alignment (e.g., Settings page).
