# 2025-09-18 10:25 ET â€“ Personality Page Modularization

## Summary
- Decomposed the Personality admin screen into focused building blocks (radio sections, trait selector, custom messages, save card, notice) under `personality-sections/` for clarity and reuse.
- Simplified `Personality.jsx` so it now manages state and handlers while the new components own presentation, mirroring the design-system structure introduced on other pages.
- Preserved the existing UX, including trait toggles and success/error notices, while readying the page for future enhancements (e.g., validation, async status indicators).

## Verification
- `npx eslint src/js/admin/pages/Personality.jsx src/js/admin/pages/personality-sections/*.jsx`
