# 2025-09-18 11:35 ET â€“ Knowledge Entry Modularization

## Summary
- Rebuilt the knowledge entry screen around `PageShell`/`SectionCard`, splitting the AI wizard, manual editor panels, and footer actions into dedicated section components under `knowledge-entry-sections/`.
- Introduced `useKnowledgeGenerator` to encapsulate the AI generation workflow (nonce handling, fetch, step transitions) and migrated all inline styling into `_knowledge-entry.scss`.
- Added loading/notice helpers and ensured the manual editor mirrors the new layout system with semantic classes.

## Verification
- `npx eslint src/js/admin/pages/KnowledgeEntry.jsx src/js/admin/pages/knowledge-entry-sections/**/*.jsx src/js/admin/pages/knowledge-entry/hooks/*.js`
