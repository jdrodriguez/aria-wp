# 2025-09-18 09:45 ET â€“ Settings Panel Modularization

## Summary
- Broke the monolithic `Settings.jsx` screen into dedicated tab panels under `src/js/admin/pages/settings-panels/` for easier maintenance and future testing.
- Added a shared `SettingsNotice` helper so each tab reuses the same dismissal logic while keeping visuals consistent with the design tokens.
- Refactored `Settings.jsx` into a lightweight orchestrator that maps tab keys to components, reducing duplicate logic and clarifying the render flow.

## Verification
- `npx eslint src/js/admin/pages/Settings.jsx src/js/admin/pages/settings-panels/*.jsx` (passes after auto-fix)
