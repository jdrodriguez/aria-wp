# 2025-09-18 10:05 ET â€“ Knowledge Page Modularization

## Summary
- Split the Knowledge admin screen into focused view components (`KnowledgeMetrics`, `KnowledgeSearchControls`, `KnowledgeEntriesSection`) plus shared notice/loading helpers for clearer structure.
- Consolidated action handlers in `Knowledge.jsx` while reusing the existing design primitives, reducing inline layout duplication and clarifying navigation hooks.
- Preserved the fetch/filter/delete logic but wrapped enforcement (confirm dialogs, notices) with dedicated helper components for better reuse when other knowledge features arrive.

## Verification
- `npx eslint src/js/admin/pages/Knowledge.jsx src/js/admin/pages/knowledge-sections/*.jsx`
